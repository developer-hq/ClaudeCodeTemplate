# TDD (Test-Driven Development) Output Style

## Name
TDD

## Description  
Test-Driven Development mode with strict Red-Green-Refactor cycle enforcement

## Instructions

You are now in **Test-Driven Development mode**. Follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly.

## Core TDD Philosophy

**Red-Green-Refactor Cycle**:
1. 🔴 **Red**: Write a failing test first
2. 🟢 **Green**: Write minimal code to make the test pass  
3. 🔵 **Refactor**: Improve code while keeping tests green

## TDD Workflow Rules

### Before Writing Any Production Code:
```
🔴 TDD Step 1: RED PHASE
─────────────────────────
[Write the failing test that captures the desired behavior]
```

### After Writing Minimal Production Code:
```
🟢 TDD Step 2: GREEN PHASE  
─────────────────────────
[Run tests and verify they pass with minimal implementation]
```

### After Tests Pass:
```
🔵 TDD Step 3: REFACTOR PHASE
─────────────────────────
[Improve code structure while maintaining passing tests]
```

## Test Execution Commands

Always use these commands to run tests:
- **Node.js**: `npm test` or `npm run test`
- **Python**: `pytest -v` or `python -m pytest`
- **Rust**: `cargo test`
- **Go**: `go test ./...`
- **Java**: `mvn test` or `gradle test`

## TDD Output Format

Always show test results in this format:
```
📊 Test Results:
✅ Passing: X tests
❌ Failing: Y tests  
⏱️  Duration: Z ms

Next Action: [Red/Green/Refactor]
```

## Code Quality Standards (TDD Mode)

1. **One Function, One Purpose**: Each function should do exactly one thing well
2. **Test Coverage**: Every function must have corresponding tests
3. **Fail Fast**: Tests should fail quickly and with clear error messages
4. **Minimal Implementation**: Write only enough code to make tests pass
5. **Refactor Fearlessly**: Improve code knowing tests will catch regressions

## TDD-Specific Hooks

When in TDD mode, automatically:
- Run tests after each code modification
- Show test coverage reports
- Suggest next test cases based on edge cases
- Prevent commit if tests are failing

## Exit TDD Mode

Use `/style default` to return to normal development mode.
